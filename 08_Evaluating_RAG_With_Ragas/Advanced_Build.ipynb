Consider a scenario where a crucial explanation spans across two chunks: \"The Federal Pell Grant provides need-based aid to students. [CHUNK BOUNDARY] This aid does not need to be repaid and can cover up to $7,000 per year.\" The connection between the grant and its non-repayable nature is severed, potentially degrading retrieval quality.\n",
