        "\n",
        "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), one fundamental question continues to challenge practitioners: **How should we divide our knowledge into digestible pieces?** This notebook ventures into the heart of this question by conducting a rigorous empirical comparison between two fundamentally different approaches to document chunking.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conventional wisdom suggests that splitting text at arbitrary character boundaries—while computationally efficient—may fracture the semantic coherence that makes information truly useful. Yet, does this intuition hold up under scrutiny? Can semantic-aware chunking strategies deliver measurable improvements that justify their additional complexity?\n",

        "### 🔧 **Baseline System**: The Pragmatic Approach\n",
        "- **Strategy**: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with fixed boundaries\n",

        "### 🧠 **Advanced System**: The Semantic Pioneer  \n",
        "- **Strategy**: Cosine similarity with dense embeddings for sentence grouping\n",
        "- **Philosophy**: Preserve meaning boundaries, optimize for coherence\n",
        "- **Characteristics**: Variable-sized chunks respecting semantic relationships using neural embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Stakes\n",
        "\n",
        "Both systems face the same rigorous evaluation battery using **five comprehensive Ragas metrics**:\n",
        "- **Faithfulness** - Does the system hallucinate or stay grounded?\n",
        "- **Answer Relevancy** - Does it actually answer what was asked?\n",
        "- **Context Precision** - Is the retrieved information truly relevant?\n",
        "- **Context Recall** - Does it find all the necessary pieces?\n",
        "- **Answer Correctness** - Is the final response accurate?\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison will reveal not just which approach performs better, but *why* certain chunking strategies succeed or fail in different dimensions of RAG performance. The results may challenge our assumptions about the trade-offs between computational efficiency and semantic intelligence in information retrieval systems.\n"

Consider a scenario where a crucial explanation spans across two chunks: \"The Federal Pell Grant provides need-based aid to students. [CHUNK BOUNDARY] This aid does not need to be repaid and can cover up to $7,000 per year.\" The connection between the grant and its non-repayable nature is severed, potentially degrading retrieval quality.\n",

        "   ```\n",

        "\n",
        "### Rigorous Measurement in the Age of AI\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluation represents the most critical phase of our investigation—where subjective intuitions about chunking quality meet objective, quantifiable metrics. The Ragas framework provides a sophisticated evaluation apparatus that goes far beyond simple accuracy measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Multi-Dimensional Assessment Strategy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional evaluation approaches often rely on single metrics that miss the nuanced ways AI systems can fail or succeed. Our five-metric evaluation strategy captures different failure modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Faithfulness**: Guards against hallucination and ensures factual grounding\n",
        "- **Answer Relevancy**: Measures whether the system addresses user intent\n",
        "- **Context Precision**: Evaluates the signal-to-noise ratio in retrieval\n",
        "- **Context Recall**: Assesses completeness of information gathering\n",
        "- **Answer Correctness**: Provides holistic accuracy measurement\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Experimental Design Principles:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Controlled Variables**: Identical evaluation LLM (gpt-4o-mini) for consistent judging\n",
        "2. **Isolated Testing**: Each system evaluated against identical question sets\n",
        "3. **Reproducible Methods**: Fixed random seeds and evaluation parameters\n",
        "4. **Statistical Validity**: Multiple test samples provide robust performance estimates\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Evaluation Approach is Revolutionary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike traditional metrics that require extensive human annotation, Ragas leverages LLM-as-a-judge techniques that scale infinitely while maintaining consistency. This approach enables comprehensive evaluation across dimensions that would be prohibitively expensive to assess manually.\n"
