        "\n",
        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",
        "- **Output Parsers**: Structure model outputs\n",
        "- **LangGraph Nodes**: Individual components in our graph\n",
        "\n",

        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Cycles?\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "\n",
        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: list[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession.

However, if the student attends only the\\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\\nstandard term.\\nMaximum Loan Periods\\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program.

Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\\nspring quarters only.\\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\\nmonths.\\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\\nterm or the spring term.\\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\\nMinimum Loan Periods\\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard'),\n",

This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\\nterm.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is'),\n",

If a student completes only part of their program (e.g., 750 out of 900 clock hours), their prorated loan limit is calculated accordingly, which for that scenario is approximately $4,583 total, with a maximum of $2,917 subsidized.\n",

            "Response: The maximum loan amount for undergraduate students consists of two components:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The total (combined subsidized and unsubsidized) outstanding loan debt that an undergraduate student can have is up to $31,000 for dependent undergraduates (excluding those whose parents cannot get Direct PLUS Loans) and up to $57,500 for independent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose parents cannot get Direct PLUS Loans).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Of this total, no more than $23,000 may consist of subsidized loans for both dependent and independent undergraduates.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the annual loan limit for undergraduates is determined based on prorated calculations if enrolled in programs shorter than an academic year; for example, in a short-term clock-hour program, the prorated annual limit could be as low as $2,420 for a first-year dependent undergraduate in a 400-clock hour, 12-week program.\n",
            "\n",
            "*Note: Please verify this information with official sources as my confidence in this response is limited.*\n",
            "\n",
            "*Fact-check note: INACCURATE: The response contains a misunderstanding regarding the maximum loan amounts for undergraduate students.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Correct information:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The **aggregate loan limit** for undergraduate students (both subsidized and unsubsidized loans combined) **is up to $31,000 for dependent students** and **up to $57,500 for independent students**. These are **lifetime limits**, not annual maximums. The response correctly states these aggregate limits.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The **annual loan limits** for undergraduate students are different and are as follows:\n",
            "   - First-year dependent undergraduate: **$5,500** total, with no more than **$3,500** of that amount in subsidized loans.\n",
            "   - Second-year dependent undergraduate: **$6,500** total, with no more than **$4,500** in subsidized loans.\n",
            "   - Third-year or beyond dependent undergraduate: **$7,500** total, with no more than **$5,500** in subsidized loans.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   For independent undergraduates, the annual limits are higher:\n",
            "   - First-year: **$9,500** total, with no more than **$3,500** subsidized.\n",
            "   - Second-year: **$10,500** total, no more than **$4,500** subsidized.\n",
            "   - Third-year and beyond: **$12,500** total, no more than **$5,500** subsidized.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The response's mention of a combined annual limit of **$5,500** (or similar figures) for first-year dependent students and prorating based on shorter programs is aligned with the rules, but it simplifies the distinctions between different years and dependency statuses.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The example about prorating loan amounts based on shorter programs is accurate in principle but less relevant to the core maximum loan amount for a standard academic year, which is determined by these specified limits.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Summary:**\n",
            "- The **$31,000** and **$57,500** figures relate to **lifetime aggregate loan limits**, not annual maximums.\n",
            "- The **annual limits** are lower and vary depending on dependency status and year in school.\n",
            "- The response conflates aggregate and annual limits, leading to inaccuracies in the initial statement about \"the maximum loan amount for undergraduate students\" as a specific annual number.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "**INACCURATE:** The response incorrectly presents the aggregate loan limits as maximum annual loan amounts for undergraduates and does not clearly distinguish between the two.*\n",

        "#### **No Relevant Context Found:**\n",
        "- **Detection**: The `enhanced_retrieve` node assesses context quality using content length and term overlap heuristics\n",
        "- **Routing**: The `route_based_on_context_quality` function routes to fallback when quality is below threshold\n",
        "- **Response**: The `fallback_response` node provides helpful guidance to users when no relevant context is found\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Fact-Checking Requirements:**\n",
        "- **Detection**: The `enhanced_generate` node identifies responses that may need fact-checking based on numerical content\n",
        "- **Routing**: The `route_fact_check` function determines whether to proceed with fact-checking\n",
        "- **Verification**: The `fact_check` node performs additional verification using the context\n",
        "- **Integration**: Fact-check results are integrated into the final response with appropriate confidence adjustments\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Additional Benefits:**\n",
        "- **Confidence Scoring**: Each response includes a confidence score that reflects the system's certainty\n",
        "- **Transparent Limitations**: Users are informed when confidence is low or when fact-checking reveals issues\n",
