Many borrowers were not adequately informed about the status of their loans, including transfer of servicing companies, payment resumption dates, or changes in payment plans. Some were unaware that interest would continue to accrue during forbearance or deferment periods, making the debt grow rather than decrease. Others faced financial difficulties due to stagnant wages, economic downturns, or personal hardships, which made it impossible to increase payments or meet the required repayment schedules. Additionally, complex or unhelpful loan repayment options, as well as administrative errors such as incorrect reporting or failure to notify about payment due dates, contributed to borrowers falling behind. Overall, issues related to poor communication, unexpected interest accumulation, and economic challenges led many to struggle with repaying their loans.'"

        "\n",
        "Explain how generating multiple reformulations of a user query can improve recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generating multiple reformulations of a user query can significantly improve recall through several mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Vocabulary Mismatch Reduction:**\n",
        "- Users and document authors often use different words to describe the same concepts\n",
        "- Multiple reformulations increase the likelihood of matching the exact terminology used in relevant documents\n",
        "- Example: A user asking \"payment issues\" might miss documents that use \"billing problems\" or \"transaction difficulties\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Query Perspective Diversification:**\n",
        "- Different reformulations can approach the same topic from various angles\n",
        "- Each perspective might surface different relevant documents that focus on specific aspects\n",
        "- Example: \"Why did loans fail?\" vs \"What caused borrower defaults?\" vs \"Reasons for payment problems\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Semantic Coverage Expansion:**\n",
        "- LLMs can generate reformulations that capture different semantic nuances of the original query\n",
        "- This helps retrieve documents that are conceptually relevant but use different language patterns\n",
        "- Increases the semantic search space beyond the original query's limited scope\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Synonym and Paraphrase Utilization:**\n",
        "- Reformulations naturally incorporate synonyms and paraphrases\n",
        "- Documents using alternative terminology become discoverable\n",
        "- Reduces dependency on exact keyword matches\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Comprehensive Document Retrieval:**\n",
        "- By retrieving documents for each reformulated query and taking the union of all results\n",
        "- The final context includes a broader set of potentially relevant documents\n",
        "- Higher chance of including the most relevant information that might have been missed by a single query\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation in Multi-Query Retriever:**\n",
        "The Multi-Query Retriever demonstrates this by:\n",
        "1. Using an LLM to generate multiple query variations\n",
        "2. Running retrieval for each variation\n",
        "3. Combining all unique documents into the final context\n",
        "4. Providing richer, more comprehensive information for answer generation\n"

        "## Task 8: Parent Document Retriever\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
        "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Okay, maybe that was a few steps - but the basic idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Search for small documents\n",
        "- Return big documents\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuition is that we're likely to find the most relevant information by limiting the amount of semantic information that is encoded in each embedding vector - but we're likely to miss relevant surrounding context if we only use that information.\n",

        "\n",
        "**How Semantic Chunking Behaves with Short, Repetitive Sentences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Problematic Similarity Patterns:**\n",
        "- Short, repetitive sentences (like FAQ questions) often have very high semantic similarity scores\n",
        "- The algorithm may struggle to find meaningful breakpoints between semantically similar content\n",
        "- Could result in either overly large chunks (everything grouped together) or overly small chunks (no grouping occurs)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Threshold Sensitivity Issues:**\n",
        "- With highly similar content, small variations in similarity scores become less meaningful\n",
        "- Percentile-based thresholding may not work effectively when most distances are very close\n",
        "- The algorithm might either chunk everything together or keep everything separate\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Loss of Logical Structure:**\n",
        "- FAQs have inherent question-answer pairs that should ideally stay together\n",
        "- Semantic chunking might break these logical pairs if focusing purely on sentence-level similarity\n",
        "- Context and structure information gets lost in favor of semantic similarity\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adjustments to Improve Performance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Threshold Method Modifications:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Use more aggressive thresholding\n",
        "semantic_chunker = SemanticChunker(\n",
        "    embeddings,\n",
        "    breakpoint_threshold_type=\"standard_deviation\",  # More sensitive to small differences\n",
        "    breakpoint_threshold_amount=1.0  # Lower threshold for more breaks\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Pre-processing Strategies:**\n",
        "- Identify FAQ structure patterns (Q: A: formatting)\n",
        "- Use regex to detect question-answer pairs\n",
        "- Apply metadata-based chunking to preserve logical pairs\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Hybrid Approaches:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Combine semantic chunking with structural rules\n",
        "- First chunk by logical structure (Q-A pairs)\n",
        "- Then apply semantic chunking within those logical boundaries\n",
        "- Use custom splitting logic for FAQ-specific patterns\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Alternative Chunking Methods:**\n",
        "- **Fixed-size chunking** with Q-A pair preservation\n",
        "- **Metadata-based chunking** using FAQ structure\n",
        "- **Custom splitters** that understand FAQ formatting\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Enhanced Similarity Calculation:**\n",
        "- Use more sophisticated embedding models that better capture subtle differences\n",
        "- Apply domain-specific embeddings trained on FAQ data\n",
        "- Consider using multiple embedding dimensions for better differentiation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommended Implementation for FAQs:**\n",
        "Rather than relying purely on semantic chunking, use a structured approach that preserves the logical Q-A relationships while still benefiting from semantic organization for related topics.\n"
