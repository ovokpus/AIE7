        "explanation": "The evolved question provides a much more detailed and focused inquiry about academic planning requirements for financial aid eligibility, significantly improving specificity and depth. However, the evolution is more complex and detailed than what a 'simple_evolution' typically implies, leading to a moderate type alignment score. The increased challenge and nuanced distinction between program types show strong complexity and innovation.",

        "explanation": "The evolved question significantly increases complexity and focuses on specific instructional design aspects in distance education, which is a notable expansion from the general student financial aid topic. However, it diverges substantially from the original subject matter, thus not matching the simple_evolution type well, which would imply a minor, straightforward refinement rather than a complete thematic shift. The transformation is creative and unique but sacrifices the original question's context.",
