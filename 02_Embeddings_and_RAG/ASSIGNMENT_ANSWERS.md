## ❓Question #1

The default embedding dimension of text-embedding-3-small is 1536, as noted above.

1. Is there any way to modify this dimension?
2. What technique does OpenAI use to achieve this?

>NOTE: Check out this API documentation for the answer to question #1, and this documentation for an answer to question #2!

### ✅ Answer #1

1. **Yes we can.** OpenAI's new embedding models support a `dimensions` API parameter that allows developers to shorten embeddings without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties. Here's how it works:

    ```python
    # Example using the dimensions parameter
    response = client.embeddings.create(
        input="Your text here",
        model="text-embedding-3-small",
        dimensions=512  # Shortened from default 1536
    )
    ```

    You can specify any dimension size you want, though certain sizes (like 256, 512, 1024) perform better as they align with the training granularities.

2. **Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)** . OpenAI confirmed that they achieved the dimension flexibility via Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). MRL encodes information at different embedding dimensionalities, enabling up to 14x smaller embedding sizes with negligible degradation in accuracy.

#### **How MRL Works:**

In contrast to common vector embeddings where all dimensions are equally important, in Matryoshka embeddings, earlier dimensions store more information than dimensions later on in the vector, which simply adds more details.

During model training with MRL, instead of optimizing just one loss function as in standard model training, several loss functions are optimized at different dimension levels. Research shows that the OpenAI embedding model was trained with 4 aggregated loss functions at dimensions = {512d, 1024d, 1536d, 3072d}.

#### **Practical Benefits:**

- **Storage efficiency**: The 256-dimensional version of text-embedding-3-large can outperform the 1536-dimensional Ada 002, providing a 6x reduction in vector size
- **Cost optimization**: Shorter embeddings reduce storage and computational costs
- **Performance flexibility**: You can trade off slight accuracy for significant speed and storage improvements

## ❓Question #2

What are the benefits of using an async approach to collecting our embeddings?

### ✅ Answer #2

### **Key Benefits of Async Embeddings:**

#### **1. Concurrent Processing**

Instead of waiting for each embedding sequentially, async allows parallel API calls:

```python
# Sync approach - slow, sequential
def sync_get_embeddings(texts):
    embeddings = []
    for text in texts:  # Each call blocks until complete
        embedding = openai_api_call(text)
        embeddings.append(embedding)
    return embeddings

# Async approach - fast, concurrent
async def async_get_embeddings(texts):
    tasks = [openai_api_call(text) for text in texts]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # All calls happen simultaneously
```

#### **2. Massive Throughput Gains**

For large text collections, the time savings are dramatic:

```python
# Processing 1000 documents:
# Sync: 1000 texts × 200ms per API call = 200 seconds
# Async: 1000 texts ÷ concurrent_limit × 200ms = ~20 seconds (10x faster)

texts = ["doc1", "doc2", ...] * 1000
start = time.time()
embeddings = await async_get_embeddings(texts)
print(f"Processed {len(texts)} embeddings in {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
```

#### **3. Better Resource Utilization**

While waiting for OpenAI API responses, your CPU can process other tasks instead of sitting idle.

#### **4. Seamless Integration with Vector DB Operations**

Your `abuild_from_list` method can process embeddings as they arrive:

```python
async def abuild_from_list(self, list_of_text: List[str]) -> "VectorDatabase":
    # Can start inserting embeddings before all are complete
    async for text, embedding in self.stream_embeddings(list_of_text):
        self.insert(text, np.array(embedding))
    return self
```

**Bottom line**: Async transforms embedding collection from a linear bottleneck into a highly concurrent operation, especially crucial when building vector databases from large document collections.

## ❓Question #3

When calling the OpenAI API - are there any ways we can achieve more reproducible outputs?

### ✅ Answer #3

### **Key Parameters for near-reproducible Outputs:**

#### **1. Structured Outputs**

You can have the model return structured data in JSON format

#### **2. Reusable Prompts**

Create reuable prompts that you can insert into the `prompt` parameter in the API client request object. This parameter contains variables that can be substituted for values

```python

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    prompt={
        "id": "pmpt_abc123",
        "version": "2",
        "variables": {
            "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
            "product": "40oz juice box"
        }
    }
)
```

#### **3. Temperature = 0**

Most important for deterministic responses:

```python
def run(self, messages, text_only: bool = True):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=self.model_name, 
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0  # Makes outputs deterministic
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content if text_only else response
```

#### **4. Seed Parameter**

OpenAI's newer reproducibility feature:

```python
def run(self, messages, text_only: bool = True, seed: int = 42):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=self.model_name, 
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
        seed=seed  # Enables reproducible outputs across calls
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content if text_only else response
```

#### **5. Additional Deterministic Controls**

```python
def run(self, messages, text_only: bool = True):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=self.model_name, 
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
        seed=42,
        top_p=1.0,  # Use full probability distribution
        max_tokens=1000,  # Consistent output length limits
        frequency_penalty=0,  # No randomness from repetition penalties
        presence_penalty=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content if text_only else response
```

#### **4. Consistent System Prompts**

```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = "gpt-4o-mini", system_prompt: str = None):
    self.system_prompt = system_prompt or "You are a helpful assistant. Be precise and consistent."

def run(self, messages, text_only: bool = True):
    # Always prepend consistent system message
    full_messages = [{"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt}] + messages
    # ... rest of API call
```

**Key insight**: `temperature=0` + `seed` parameter give you the most reproducible results for testing and production consistency.

## ❓Question #4

What prompting strategies could you use to make the LLM have a more thoughtful, detailed response?

What is that strategy called?

### ✅ Answer #4

The strategy or technique we could use to make the LLM more thoughtful and detailed is called:

## **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

The primary strategy is called **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** - encouraging the model to show its reasoning process step-by-step.

### **1. Basic CoT Implementation**

```python
def run_with_cot(self, user_message: str, text_only: bool = True):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Think step by step and show your reasoning process."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"{user_message}\n\nLet's think through this step by step:"}
    ]
    return self.run(messages, text_only)
```

### **2. Enhanced CoT with Structured Thinking**

```python
def run_detailed_analysis(self, user_message: str, text_only: bool = True):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": """You are a thorough analyst. For each question:
        1. Break down the problem
        2. Consider multiple perspectives  
        3. Analyze pros/cons
        4. Provide detailed reasoning
        5. Give a comprehensive conclusion"""},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]
    return self.run(messages, text_only)
```

### **3. Few-Shot CoT Examples**

```python
def run_with_examples(self, user_message: str, text_only: bool = True):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Provide detailed, thoughtful responses with clear reasoning."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I optimize database queries?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": """Let me think through database optimization systematically:

1. **Query Analysis**: First, I need to understand what's slow...
2. **Indexing Strategy**: Based on the query patterns...
3. **Query Structure**: Looking at joins and subqueries...
[detailed response continues]"""},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]
    return self.run(messages, text_only)
```

### **4. Role-Based Expert Prompting**

```python
def run_as_expert(self, user_message: str, expertise_domain: str, text_only: bool = True):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": f"""You are a senior {expertise_domain} expert with 15+ years of experience. 
        Provide comprehensive, detailed analysis drawing from your deep expertise. 
        Think through problems methodically and explain your reasoning."""},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]
    return self.run(messages, text_only)
```

**Key principle**: CoT prompting works by making the model's "thinking process" explicit, leading to more accurate and detailed responses because the model must justify each step of its reasoning.

```python
async def async_get_embeddings(self, list_of_text: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
    response = await openai.Embedding.acreate(
        input=list_of_text, engine=self.embeddings_model_name
    )
    return [embedding.embedding for embedding in response.data]
```

#### **2. Chat Completion** (`aimakerspace/openai_utils/chatmodel.py` lines 19-21)  

```python
def run(self, messages, text_only: bool = True):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=self.model_name, messages=messages
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content if text_only else response
```
